<h1>Defensive Security Using Splunk</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
For this project, I used a Docker container to run Splunk Enterprise from a virtual machine. In this project, I played the role of a SOC analyst for a small company named Virtual Space Industries (VSI). The task at hand is to monitor against potential attacks on the clients systems and applications. These systems and applications include an administrative webpage, an apache web server that hosts it, and a windows operating system which runs VSI's back-end operations. I was supplied with windows/apache server logs of what's considered "regular" activity and windows/apache server logs that demonstrate an attack. I used Splunk to create baselines, alerts, visuals, and dashboards using the logs of "regular" activity. That activity was then compared to that of the "attack" logs. I think recommended potential mitigations for the attacks that occured.
